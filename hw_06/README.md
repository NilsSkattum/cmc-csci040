# HW 6: Creating a twitter clone

**Description:** 
You will create a twitter clone using the Flask web framework.

**Due:** 
Wednesday, 18 December

**Learning objectives:**

1. create large Python programs that span multiple files
1. develop a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) web app
1. understand how social media websites work under the hood

## Grading rubric

Your webpage must have a route that accomplishes each of the following tasks:

1. Create user account (make sure to prevent users from creating accounts that already exist)
1. Log in 
1. Create a message
1. View all messages (the messages should be ordered chronologically and each message should include the user account that created it, the time of creation, and the message contents)

Each of these tasks is worth 20 points, for a total of 80 points.

An additional 10 points is for your webpage appropriately using css and html for styling.

The assignment is out of 100 points, and to get the remaining 10 points you must complete some of the extra credit.

## Extra credit

You can get 5pts extra credit if you:

1. can access your twitter clone from other computers (see for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7023052/configure-flask-dev-server-to-be-visible-across-the-network)

1. can delete individual messages

1. can edit messages after they've been created

1. can delete user accounts

1. can change the password after creating an account

You can get 10pts of extra credit if you:

1. populate your twitter clone with at least 50 user accounts and 1000 messages

1. add user profile pages that a user can edit to provide a description about themselves

1. assign each user an avatar, and have that avatar appear with each post

You can get 20pts of extra credit if you:

1. implement a search function

1. add the ability to reply to other user's messages (the replies must display in a threaded fashion similar to twitter or reddit)

1. support multiple languages

1. implement any of the above features using AJAX

<!--1. use SQLite3 instead of JSON to store-->

## Submission

You must bring a laptop to my office and demo your project to me.
(This should take 5-10 minutes.)

You may schedule a time in advance of the due date to privately show your project to me,
or wait until the due date and do it as a group during special office hours (TBD).
