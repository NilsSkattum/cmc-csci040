**Thursday:**

1. There is no prelab work.

## Lab

1. Select a high profile Twitter user.
   Use Firefox's developer console to edit one of their tweets to say something they would never say.
   Take a screenshot and post the screenshot to GitHub Issues.
   (I will create the issues link at the beginning of lab.)

1. How to remove ads/popups/other crap from websites:

    1. Visit [this webpage](https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/).
       Use firefox's developer console to delete the paywall (both the popup and the gray background).

    1. Refresh the webpage.
       (Notice that the popup has returned.)

    1. Follow the instructions on [this webpage](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/02/21/ublock-origin-how-to-remove-any-element-from-a-page-permanently/) to create a rule for blocking the popup permanently with uBlock Origin. 

    1. Refresh the webpage.
       (If you've done everything corrently, the popup has not returned.)

    1. Take a screenshot of the cleaned up webpage,
       and submit the screenshot to sakai.

1. That's it!
   You can use the rest of the lab time to work on the homework.

   **HINT:** Now would be a good time to arrange with other students in the class to share backlinks to each other's websites!
