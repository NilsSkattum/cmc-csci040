**Quiz:**
The completed `quiz.pdf` should be submitted to sakai by Friday at midnight.

**Monday:** We will cover [Chapter 6 - Strings](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter6/) and [Chapter 7 - Regular Expressions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter7/) of the book.

Prelecture videos:

Regular expressions are an advanced topic that we're not going to cover in detail,
and you will never be required to write a regular expression in this class.
If you've done programming before, however,
I strongly recommend you try to learn regular expressions in detail,
as they can greatly simplify your code.
The following video provides a good tutorial.
