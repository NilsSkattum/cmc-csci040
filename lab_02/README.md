# Lab 2

The file `lab.py` contains several incomplete functions that you must write.
Each function has several test cases provided in the docstring,
and currently all of these test cases are failing.
Your job is to make them pass.

Your grade on this assignment will be the percentage of these test cases that pass.
For example, if you have 25 out of 30 test cases passing, then you will receive 83.3%.
