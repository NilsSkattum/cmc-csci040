# Lab 6b: Installing Python libraries

The best part of Python is its "library ecosystem."
Many programmers have created excellent libraries that you can easily incorporate into your own projects.
The purpose of this lab is to ensure that your python environment is set up properly to download, install, and use these libraries.

### Background

We will use the `youtube-dl` library to demonstrate how to download and install libraries.  `youtube-dl` is a library for downloading videos from youtube in order to play them on your own computer.

In Python, all libraries are downloaded using a command called `pip`.  Open up your terminal, and type the command

```
$ pip3 install youtube-dl
```

**NOTE:** You do not type the `$` in the command above.  Also, depending on how your machine is configured, you might need to replace the `pip3` command with `pip`.

**NOTE:** If you do not have `pip` installed, then you can follow these directions to get it installed on your system: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/

### Assignment

To complete this assignment, use the `youtube-dl` command to download the classic rickrolling video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ ) and upload this video to sakai.

Rickrolling is a famous internet meme with a fascinating wikipedia article that I highly recommend reading: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
