**Quiz:**
The completed `quiz.pdf` should be submitted to sakai by Friday at midnight.

**Monday:** We will cover [Chapter 16 - Working with CSV Files and JSON Data](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter16/) of the book.

Prelecture videos:

1. Corey Schafer's [Working with JSON Data using the json Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N6a-VLBa2I)

**Wednesday:**
We will cover the matplotlib library.
The textbook does not have a chapter on using the matplotlib library,
but the library itself has a great set of tutorials that you can use as a reference:
https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/tutorials/index.html

Prelecture videos:

1. Corey Schafer has a [full set of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_) that covers everything about matplotlib.
   You don't need to watch all of these videos,
   but I recommend watching at least the first one.

**Thursday:** Lab.

There is no prelab work.

## Lab

There are two parts to this week's lab.

1. Part I is worth 10 points, like normal.
   The instructions for part 1 are contained in the `lab_part1.py` file.

2. Part II is worth only 3 points, and is "optional" in the sense that if you choose not to complete it then it will have a negligible impact on your final grade.
   In this part of the lab, you will complete the doctests in `lab_part2.py` just like normal.
